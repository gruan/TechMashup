		<h1>Main Idea</h1>
		<p1>Our tech mashup would unify the fragmented world that the
		average freshman has to navigate at the UIUC in the College of
		Engineering. As with anyone trying to accomplish anything it is important
		to have a plan on how times is spent. Deadlines make it easier to
		prioritize not only when stuff needs to be done but also when it needs
		to be done. Scheduling can help to organize the madness of freshman
		year, but sometimes what needs to happen is to stop and only look at
		what is next. There comes a time when the average freshman is so
		overburdened with demands that he or she must simply look at the next
		task at hand. To quote a famous blue fish, "Just keep swimming" can
		become a must. It is important to just look at what needs to be done
		next, but often this is not always possible or easy.</p1>

		<h2>The Websites</h2>
		<p2>This is where our mashup comes in. Physics classes use SmartPhysics, which is
		great if you only take physics classes, and Math classes use Webassign, which
		is great if you only take math classes, and Chemistry classes use LON-CAPA,
		which is great if you only take Chemistry, ... and on and on it goes.
		with each new class that a freshman enrolls in, a strange new site is
		added to the daily checklist to navigate and peruse to find some type
		of useful information. With our website, we would have a
		must-have-tool to make it in college as a freshman. You would learn the ropes
		about which websites to use and how to use them, while the
		overall experience for a frustrated freshman is no longer so fragmented and
		confusing.</p2>

		<h3>Why This Website Works</h3>
		<p2>This website will allow users to customize the list of classes and links 
		related to each class by simply clicking a button to add each. By checking the 
		small box next to each individual link, users will be able to open all of these
		check-marked links in a new window. This opened window will open a new tab for each 
		link selected, greatly easing the process of opening multiple class websites and 
		commonly
		used links. </p2>

		<h3>Problems of Today</h3>
		<p2>The digital age in which we currently live in is full of technological challenges for 
		those proficient in this type of technology, and those who are not. By unifying the 
		separate worlds of the classroom and internet, we allow students to conveniently
		keep track of the work they need to finish and the locations of the resources they need.</p2>
