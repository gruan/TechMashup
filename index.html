		<h2>Main Idea</h2>
		<p1>Our tech mashup would unify the fragmented world that the
		average freshman has to navigate at the UIUC in the College of
		Engineering.</p1>

		<h3>Schedules and Deadlines</h3>
		<p2>As with anyone trying to accomplish anything it is important
		to have a plan on how times is spent. Deadlines make it easier to
		prioritize not only when stuff needs to be done but also when it needs
		to be done. Scheduling can help to organize the madness of freshman
		year, but sometimes what needs to happen is to stop and only look at
		what is next. There comes a time when the average freshman is so
		overburdened with demands that he or she must simply look at the next
		task at hand. To quote a famous blue fish, "Just keep swimming" can
		become a must. It is important to just look at what needs to be done
		next, but often this is not always possible or easy.</p2>

		<h3>The Websites</h3>
		<p2>This is where we come in. Physics uses SmartPhysics, which is
		great if you only take physics classes, and Math uses Webassign, which
		is great if you only take math classes, and Chemistry uses LON-CAPA,
		which is great if you only take Chemistry, ... and on and on it goes.
		with each new class that a freshman enters, a strange new site is
		added to the daily checklist to navigate and peruse to find some type
		of useful information. With our website, we would have a
		must-have-tool to make it as a freshman. You would learn the ropes
		about which websites use and how to use them, but aggregated the
		overall experience for a freshman is no longer so fragmented and
		confusing.</p2>
