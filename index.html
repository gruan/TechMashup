		<h2>Main Idea</h2>
		<p1>Our tech mashup would unify the fragmented world that the average freshman
		 has to navigate at the UIUC in the College of Engineering.</p1>
		
		<h3>Schedules and Deadlines</h3>
		<p2>As with anyone trying to accomplish anything it is important to have a plan 
		on how times is spent.  Deadlines make it easier to prioritize not only when stuff
		needs to be done but also when it needs to be done. Scheduling can help to organize 
	    the madness of freshman year, but sometimes what needs to happen is to stop and only
		look at what is next. There comes a time when the average freshman is so overburdened with demands that he
		or she must simply look at the next task at hand.  To quote a famous blue fish, "Just
		keep swimming" can become a must.  It is important to just look at what needs to be done 
		next, but often this is not always possible or easy.</p2>
		
		<h3>The Websites</h3>	
		<p2>This is where we come in.  Physics uses SmartPhysics, which is great if you only
		take physics classes, and Math uses Webassign, which is great if you only take math classes,
		and Chemistry uses LON-CAPA, which is great if you only take Chemistry, ... and on and on it goes.
		with each new class that a freshman enters, a strange new site is added to the daily 
		checklist to navigate and peruse to find some type of useful information.  With our website, we 
		would have a must-have-tool to make it as a freshman.  You would learn the ropes about which websites
		use and how to use them, but aggregated the overall experience for a freshman is no longer so fragmented and confusing.</p2>
